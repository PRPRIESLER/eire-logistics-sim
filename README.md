# Ireland Logistics Simulation & Optimization Engine 🚚🇮🇪

**A full-scale logistics command center for simulating, analyzing, and optimizing delivery networks across Irish cities.**

This project generates 50,000+ simulated delivery trips across Ireland using OpenStreetMap and CSO geographic data, routed through a local OSRM instance. It’s designed to replicate realistic delivery logistics for food or e-commerce, with plans for anomaly detection, traffic impact analysis, and optimization using Google OR-Tools.

---

## 🔥 Features (Phase 1 – In Progress)

- ✅ Delivery trip generation using weighted urban populations
- ✅ Real geospatial delivery points within Irish urban polygons (CSO data)
- ✅ Route distances and durations using OSRM
- 🔄 Data export for analysis and modeling

---

## 💡 Coming Soon

- 🔍 Route anomaly detection (outliers in time/distance)
- ⏰ Peak hour demand modeling
- 🧠 Delivery optimization using Google OR-Tools
- 📈 Power BI dashboards / Jupyter reports

## 📂 Data Sources

- 🗺️ **OpenStreetMap** (`.osm.pbf` file)
- 📐 **CSO Urban & Small Area Boundaries** (GeoJSON from [CSO.ie](https://www.cso.ie/))
